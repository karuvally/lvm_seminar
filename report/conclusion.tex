\chapter{Conclusion}
Though the Logical Volume Manager is a fairly complex storage system, it has
been engineered to provide performance figures similar to the ones provided by
traditional partitioning.\\

LVM is easy to setup, is practically free and provides a number of features such
as convinient backups through snapshots, easy resizing of partitions and
improved performance using striped volumes without dragging the system down to
a crawl.
