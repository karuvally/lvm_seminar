\chapter{Conclusion}
Though the Logical Volume Manager is a fairly complex storage system, it has
been engineered to provide performance figures similar to the ones provided by
traditional partitioning.\\

LVM is easy to setup, is practically free and provides a number of features such
as convinient backups through snapshots, easy resizing of partitions and
improved performance using striped volumes while providing satisfactory
performance. The study concluded that LVM is capable of being a viable
replacement to traditional partitioning in both server and development
environments.
